Hereâ€™s a **professional Replit AI prompt** you can paste directly, crafted to minimize hallucinations and ensure the AI follows the hackathon requirements strictly:

**Replit AI Prompt:**

We are building a hackathon project called **EduSense â€“ AI Tutor for All**, aligned with **SDG 4: Quality Education**. Please follow these instructions exactly, without hallucinating or inventing technologies:

### ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack (must be used)

- **Frontend**: HTML5 + CSS (animations) + JavaScript (flip cards)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask) + MySQL
- **AI**: Hugging Face Question-Answering API
- **Payments**: IntaSend

### ðŸ“Œ Development Rules

1. Write **beginner-friendly, well-documented code** with comments.
2. Every implemented step must be committed with a **robust, descriptive commit message** (not atomic, not vague).
3. Database schema and sample inserts must be stored in a file called **`answers.sql`**.
4. Provide a clear **README.md** including:

   - Project description
   - Setup instructions
   - Tech stack used
   - Contributor names, roles, and emails

5. If a feature cannot be implemented, clearly explain why instead of guessing.

### ðŸ“Œ Features to Implement (Step by Step)

- [ ] Build the **frontend** with flip-card animations for flashcards.
- [ ] Set up **Flask backend** with input (student notes) and output (generated flashcards).
- [ ] Integrate **Hugging Face QA API** to generate quiz questions from notes.
- [ ] Store generated flashcards in **MySQL** (schema in `answers.sql`).
- [ ] Display results interactively on the frontend (flip cards).
- [ ] Add **IntaSend integration** for premium subscription features (analytics, advanced quizzes).
- [ ] Include **testing, error handling, and documentation**.

### ðŸ“Œ Commit Message Examples

- `"Initialize Flask backend and project structure"`
- `"Implement Hugging Face QA API for flashcard generation"`
- `"Create MySQL schema and integrate with Flask backend"`
- `"Add interactive HTML/CSS/JS flip-card UI for flashcards"`
- `"Integrate IntaSend for subscription-based premium features"`
- `"Write README.md with setup guide and contributor details"`

### ðŸ“Œ Deliverables

- A working prototype hosted on Replit.
- Clean, structured codebase with commits for each feature.
- `answers.sql` for database setup.
- README with all required details.
